# Employee-Attrition-Prediction-using-R
This project analyzes employee data to predict attrition using Multiple Linear Regression and Logistic Regression models in R. The objective is to identify factors influencing employee turnover and provide actionable insights for HR teams to improve employee retention strategies.
#Technologies Used
R Programming (tidyverse, caret, ggplot2)
Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests
Visualization: ggplot2 for EDA and result plots
#Key Steps in the Project
Data Import & Cleaning – Handling missing values, encoding categorical variabl
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing attrition patterns
Feature Engineering – Selecting and transforming key predictors
Model Building – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree models
Model Evaluation – Accuracy, ROC curve, confusion matrix
Insights & Recommendations – Key factors influencing attrition
